How technology comes to automate and optimize processes, i decided doing something like that to developers. You just need input the name of project and program goes to github, logs in, goes to new repository page, inform the repository's name typed by you, get the project's adress from github, and execute the creating commands, opens the VScode with a readme.md already started.

## Getting Started

To run and test the program, you basically need to put this files above some directory, like a root default 'foo' and type node server.js. From there your project will always path foo/name_of_project. 

## Built With

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built
* [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) - Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome

## Next Step

Write some text automatically into a readme.md like an introduction to theme

This project looks great, - it's time to merge! :shipit:
