# Web Scraping GitHub

How technology comes to automate and optimize processes, i decided a stuff like that to devolopers. You just need input the name of propject and program goes to github, log in, go to new repository page, inform the repository's you typed, get the project's adress github, and execute the creating commands github, open the VScode with a readme.md started.
